# Age and Gender Detection Using Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning techniques to predict a personâ€™s gender and estimate their age from facial images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system automatically learns visual features for accurate classification and regression, enabling applications in biometrics, security, and human-computer interaction.
